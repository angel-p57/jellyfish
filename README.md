# Jellyfish

Jellyfish is a two-dimensional esoteric programming language inspired by J and written in Python 3.
Development is slow but ongoing, so things may freeze for a long time and then break without notice.

At the moment, there's a bare-bones interpreter with no documentation.
It can be invoked by the command

    python jellyfish.py <source_file>

The only datatypes are nested arrays of numbers and characters.
Input is taken from STDIN, and output goes to STDOUT.
